Task: Build an E-commerce Web App

Objective:

Create a web application that displays a list of products with their prices and ratings. Some products may not have ratings, so ensure that the ratings section is conditionally rendered.

Components:

1. ProductList.js: Responsible for rendering a list of products
2. Product.js: Responsible for rendering a single product
3. Price.js: Responsible for rendering the price of a product
4. Ratings.js: Responsible for rendering the ratings of a product

JSON Data:

1. products.json: Contains the list of products with their details (name, price, ratings, etc.)

Requirements:

1. Fetch or import the products JSON data in ProductList.js
2. Map over the products array and render a Product component for each product
3. In Product.js, render the product name, price (using the Price component), and ratings (using the Ratings component) if they exist
4. In Price.js, render the price of the product
5. In Ratings.js, map over the ratings array and render each rating with its corresponding review
6. Conditionally render the Ratings component in Product.js if the product has ratings

Note: Ensure that the components are properly imported and exported, and that the JSON data is properly fetched or imported.
